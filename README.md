SpudoKu
=======

Do you love to play [ColorKu](http://colorku.com/)?
So do I!

But what do you do when
you've gone through all the puzzle cards that come with it, or
they've gotten too hard, or maybe you've lost them or your pet
bunny chewed them up?  That's where *SpudoKu* can help!

**SpudoKu?  What's that?**

You're looking at it!  SpudoKu is a website that
can fetch billions of sudoku puzzles from the fine folks at
[websudoku.com](http://websudoku.com/) (thanks,
fine folks!) and display them in your browser with the ColorKu
colors you've come to know and love, so you can set them up
on your ColorKu board and solve them!  Puzzles come in your choice
of *Easy, Medium, Hard,* or, for the ColorKu super-heroes
among us, *Evil* (bwa ha ha).

SpudoKu can also show you the complete solution to the ColorKu puzzle
by clicking the "Show Solution" button, or it can show you the solution
of each ball individually by clicking on that ball.

**Get the Android app!**

I've made an Android app that creates ColorKu puzzles on your phone.
You can solve them on your phone, or set them up and solve them on
your ColorKu board.

And if you get stuck, it can give you *hints*.
