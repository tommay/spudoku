SpudoKu
=======

Do you love to play [ColorKu](http://colorku.com/)?
So do I!

But what do you do when
you've gone through all the puzzle cards that come with it, or
they've gotten too hard, or maybe you've lost them or your pet
bunny chewed them up?  That's where *SpudoKu* can help!

**SpudoKu?  What's that?**

You're looking at it!  SpudoKu is a website that
can fetch billions of sudoku puzzles from the fine folks at
[websudoku.com](http://websudoku.com/) (thanks,
fine folks!) and display them in your browser with the ColorKu
colors you've come to know and love, so you can set them up
on your ColorKu board and solve them!  Puzzles come in your choice
of *Easy, Medium, Hard,* or, for the ColorKu super-heroes
among us, *Evil* (bwa ha ha).

SpudoKu can also show you the complete solution to the ColorKu puzzle
by clicking the "Solved" button, or it can show you the solution
of each ball individually by clicking on that ball.

**In the works:** I intend to hook SpudoKu up to my sudoku solver
to provide *hints* for when you get stuck.

**And then . . .** I'd like to do an Android app.  If you're on
iPhone, sorry.  If you're on BlackBerry, I'm even sorrier.
